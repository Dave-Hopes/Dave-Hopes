# Hi everyone 👋

## Who am I
I am a young developper from the UK. I am currently in my first year of Art school at the University of the Arts London. But it isn't really what I expected so, here I am...Trying to learn programming. Hope you all can enjoy follow me on my journey and give me tips and help me learn everything there is to becoming a web developper.

## My qualities
- Drawing (duh)
- Quick learner
- Multilingual (english, french, spanish)
- Curious (even though my parents say its not)
- Creative

## My flaws
- Introverted/antisocial
- Doesn't do too well in groups
- May hyperfocus on the wrong things
- No knowledge of social queues
- Curious (According to my parents)

## What I like
I like drawing, listening to music and learning new things that interest me. My favourite animal are geese, they are so cute angry and spiteful I love them so much. I also love taking walks and going into places I'm not really supposed to go. For example I was the one who broke into a wearhouse near my home to spray paint and do street art, I wasn't caught though. But anyways yea I like letting myself wander wherever I feel like, it clears my mind and helps give me ideas.

## What I would like to learn
I heard a few of my friends on Discord talk about tech stacks so whatever those are, also python as my first language, I also learnt about figma recently so I would like to make my first online website soon so my parents can see how competent I have become and let me pursue programming. Maybe learn about Linux? I heard a bunch of people in the community use it so it seems like a good idea to follow right? And finally as a goal of mine make at least 1 pull request (My friends told me about that 😁)
on a repository that I like and want to contribute to, but that will have to wait until I am competent enought.

## Fun facts about me
- Both my parents love art and want me to pursue it
- My work has appeared at art shows (they were for school)
- I am a massive nerd
- I love the SCP universe (SCP-294 my beloved)
- I do Watercolors and oil painting
- I often stay in my room to paint and recently to code
- I just found out about github so I'll have alot of projects to put
- Coding has helped me be more social surprisingly
- I have tried to make music before (it was bad)
- I almost died once (did not ventilate my room correctly while doing oil paints haha)
- Fan of philosophy and litterature (Camus, Aristotle, Diogen, Socrates, Absurdism, **Ghost in the machine*, ihnmams, the stranger, metamorphosis...)
